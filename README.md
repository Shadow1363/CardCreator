# How to use
1. Try it out here: https://shadow1363.github.io/Sheet2Card/
2. Upload a .tsv file that follows has this as a header:

3. For my use case, the max limit of cards is 2 copies so it loads the file twice.
4. Click on cards to remove them to create your own deck.
5. Then press "e" to export as an image. (May take a while)

# Planned Features
- Hidden Card + Back Art Card Exporter
- Export an Image that can be imported to import deck (Pico-8)
- Chart.Js integration (See cost curve, type split, etc)
- Proper deck building (Search bar, have full cardlist seperate from exporting/making deck)
- Modular structure (As in you don't have to manually edit the code to work with your template)
- UI/Code improvements
- Simple paint program to add card art.
- My own card wiki page
